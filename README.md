# Mastermind-board-game-
Mastermind or Master Mind is a code-breaking game for two players. It resembles an earlier pencil and paper game called Bulls and Cows that may date back a century. 
Mastermind is a two-player code-breaking game. 
The codemaker conceals four colored pins. 
The code maker (in this case, the system) covertly sets four colored pegs in the squares behind a viewing screen at the far end of the board. 
(In this case, the system employs integers from 1 to 6 to represent the six numbers, namely 1-White, 2-Blue, 3-Red, 4-Yellow, 5-Green, and 6-Purple, and creates a four-digit number at random. 
By entering four digits, the code breaker guesses the concealed peg. 
To discover the hidden peg, the codebreaker must correctly identify the color and position. 
The codebreaker marks the right guesses with small pegs in each guess. 
If the guessed pegs are the correct color and in the right location, the system uses the 'black' peg (here as '1'), otherwise the system uses the 'white' peg (here denoted as '0'). If the color is absolutely incorrect, the system does not use any pegs and leaves them vacant.
